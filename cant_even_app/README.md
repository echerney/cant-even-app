# VOAAS

This was a small weekend project designed to learn ruby on rails, and is a "heathlier" version of the <a href="http://foaas.com/">FOAAS</a> api that had recently been designed. The app uses input from the users to design a randomized response of frustration/anger/general malaise about the world. This was my first use of ruby on rails to build a project start to finish.
